from the data

- Entire home/apt, Private room and Shared rooms are the three types of rooms provided and all of the rooms are closely situated and looks like all the rooms are spread in and around new york
- The number of rooms are similar for these two types - Entire home/apt, Private room. It is very less for the room type 'Shared rooms'.
- the 75% of the bookins were for 5 days or less than this and maximum is 1250 days (data may not be correct)
- Majority of the room bookings is for one night only - majority of the bookings are within 30 days
- the mean price is 152 USD and 75% of the data lies within 175 USD and maximum number of rooms booked have a rate within USD 0 - 200.
- the wide range between the minimum and maximum prices, as well as the relatively large standard deviation, suggest that prices vary significantly in the dataset.
- 'Entire home/apt' fetches more revenues (by more than 3 times) than the next type of rooms.
- reviews does not have a bearing on the max room rent
- reviews per month seems to be same in all months, looks like reviews does not have much influence.
- comparison between top performing and worst performing host
    the availability of the rooms is almost four times the worst performing host and the reviews is also 10 times than the worst perforing host
    the number of reviews is much higher as expected, since worst performing host does not have any bookings
- Factors contributing to the success - does not have much data to decide - Also no information is there to decide what is 'success'
